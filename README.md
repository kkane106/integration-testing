# Integration Testing
* Simple examples of integration tests with Spring

***NOTE***: both of these example files are not runnable (the public class and file names don't match so this should be obvious)

***NOTE***: both examples require an existing Test-context.xml spring config file to load the application context...this includes things like creating and EntityManager Factor to extract the @PersistenceContext from, as well as a TransactionManager and a context:component-scan

* Both of these examples are meant explicitly for reference purposes and not use.
